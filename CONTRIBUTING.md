```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new files
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components
- **Components**: Create functional components with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with the `@/` alias

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// Good component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  isVisible?: boolean;
}

export default function Component({ title, isVisible = true }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic here
  
  return (
    <div className="component-class">
      {/* JSX here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Styling Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Follow the existing custom CSS classes in `globals.css`
- Use the design system colors and spacing
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach)

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `InterviewCard.tsx`)
- Pages: `page.tsx` (Next.js App Router convention)
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Types: `camelCase.ts` or `index.ts`

## Issue Workflow
